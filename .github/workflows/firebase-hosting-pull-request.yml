              The preview deployment was skipped because Firebase Hosting has reached its preview channel limit.

              **What this means:**
              - ✅ Your code changes are valid and the build succeeded
              - ❌ No preview URL available for this PR
              - ℹ️ Changes will deploy to production when merged to main

              **To fix:**
              Run the [Cleanup Preview Channels](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/workflows/cleanup-preview-channels.yml) workflow to free up quota.`
