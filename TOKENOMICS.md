Top 10 players in each game earn daily rewards:

| Rank | % of Pool | Daily Reward | Monthly Potential |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1st | 25% | 2,500 8BIT | 75,000 8BIT |

| 6th-10th | 5% ea | 500 8BIT | 15,000 8BIT |

**Total Daily Distribution:** 10,000 8BIT across all games

### Tournament Structure

#### Standard Tier
- **Weekly Entry:** $1 USDC → Prize Pool: 5,000 8BIT
- **Monthly Entry:** $5 USDC → Prize Pool: 10,000 8BIT

#### High Roller Tier ⭐
- **Weekly Entry:** $5 USDC → Prize Pool: 15,000 8BIT
- **Monthly Entry:** $25 USDC → Prize Pool: 50,000 8BIT

## 🔥 Deflationary Mechanisms

### Token Burn (50% of Tournament Fees)

**How it works:**
- Tournament entry fees collected in USDC
- 50% permanently burned (removed from supply)
- 50% funds prize pools
- Creates deflationary pressure as adoption grows

**Example:**
- High Roller Monthly: $25 entry
- $12.50 → Burned (buy back 8BIT and burn)
- $12.50 → Prize pool funding

**Long-term effect:** As more players compete, more tokens are permanently removed from circulation, reducing supply and potentially increasing value for holders.
