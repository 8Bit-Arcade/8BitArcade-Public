## 🔥 Deflationary Mechanisms

### Token Burn (50% of Tournament Fees)

**How it works:**
- Tournament entry fees collected in USDC
- 50% permanently burned (removed from supply)
- 50% funds prize pools
- Creates deflationary pressure as adoption grows

**Example:**
- High Roller Monthly: $25 entry
- $12.50 → Burned (buy back 8BIT and burn)
- $12.50 → Prize pool funding

**Long-term effect:** As more players compete, more tokens are permanently removed from circulation, reducing supply and potentially increasing value for holders.
