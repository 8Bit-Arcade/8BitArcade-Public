## 🔥 Burn Mechanisms (Deflationary Pressure)

Following industry best practices to prevent inflation:

### 1. Tournament Entry Fees (50% burned)
**Standard Weekly:** 2,000 8BIT entry × 50 players = 100K collected → **50K burned**
**High Roller Weekly:** 10,000 8BIT entry × 30 players = 300K collected → **150K burned**
**Standard Monthly:** 10,000 8BIT entry × 40 players = 400K collected → **200K burned**
**High Roller Monthly:** 50,000 8BIT entry × 20 players = 1M collected → **500K burned**

**Monthly Tournament Burns:** ~1-2M tokens

### 2. Marketplace Fees (100% burned)
- NFT badge sales: 2.5% fee burned
- Profile customization: All fees burned

### 3. Premium Features (75% burned)
- Username changes: 1,000 8BIT → 750 burned
- Special badges: 500 8BIT → 375 burned
- Custom emotes: 250 8BIT → 187.5 burned

### 4. Staking Penalties (100% burned)
- Early unstaking: Penalty burned
- Reduces circulating supply

**Estimated Total Burn Rate:** 30,000-50,000 8BIT/day
**Net Emission (Year 1):** 100,000-120,000 8BIT/day (after burns)

## 📊 5-Year Projection

| Year | Daily Emission | Annual Emission | Circulating Supply | % of Total |
|------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 0 (Launch) | - | 300M* | 300M | 30% |
| 1 | 150K | 54.75M | 354.75M | 35.5% |
| 2 | 130K | 47.45M | 402.2M | 40.2% |
| 3 | 110K | 40.15M | 442.35M | 44.2% |
| 4 | 90K | 32.85M | 475.2M | 47.5% |
| 5 | 70K | 25.55M | 500.75M | 50.1% |

*Launch includes: Sale (100M) + Liquidity (200M)

**Notes:**
- Assumes founder vesting on schedule
- Doesn't account for burns (reduces supply by ~10-15%)
- Ecosystem development released gradually
- Staking may lock 20-40% of circulating
- Unsold sale tokens burned (could reduce total supply)

**Realistic Circulating (with burns):**
- Year 1: ~320M (10% burned)
- Year 3: ~400M (12% burned)
- Year 5: ~450M (15% burned)
