# Emissions Schedule

## Token Release Timeline

Complete breakdown of when and how 8BIT tokens enter circulation over time.

## Overview

Unlike many projects with decades-long emission schedules, 8-Bit Arcade uses a **5-year accelerated distribution model** to maximize player rewards NOW, not 20 years from now.

### Key Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Supply** | 500,000,000 8BIT |
| **Initial Circulation** | ~200,000,000 (40%) |
| **Rewards Pool** | 150,000,000 (30%) |
| **Distribution Period** | 5 years (60 months) |
| **Monthly Emissions** | 2,500,000 8BIT |
| **Annual Inflation** | ~6% (Years 1-5 only) |

## Monthly Emissions Breakdown

### 2,500,000 8BIT Released Monthly

Every month, exactly 2.5M tokens are distributed to players through:

## Yearly Emissions Schedule

### Year 1: 30,000,000 8BIT

| Quarter | Emissions | Circulating Supply | Inflation Rate |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Q1 | 7,500,000 | ~207.5M | 3.6% |
| Q2 | 7,500,000 | ~215M | 3.5% |
| Q3 | 7,500,000 | ~222.5M | 3.4% |
| Q4 | 7,500,000 | ~230M | 3.3% |

**Year 1 Summary:**
- Total rewards paid: 30M tokens
- Average monthly: 2.5M
- Circulating increases: 200M → 230M
- Effective inflation: ~15% (high but front-loaded)

### Year 2: 30,000,000 8BIT

| Quarter | Emissions | Circulating Supply | Inflation Rate |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Q1-Q4 | 30,000,000 | ~260M | 11.5% |

**Year 2 Summary:**
- Same emission rate (2.5M/month)
- Lower inflation % as supply grows
- Deflationary burns begin reducing supply

### Year 3-5: 30,000,000 8BIT Each

- **Year 3:** 30M distributed → ~290M circulating
- **Year 4:** 30M distributed → ~320M circulating
- **Year 5:** 30M distributed → ~350M circulating

**Declining Inflation:**
- Year 3: ~10.3% inflation
- Year 4: ~9.4% inflation
- Year 5: ~8.6% inflation

### Year 6+: Zero Emissions

- **No new tokens** from rewards pool
- Staking rewards continue (separate 50M pool)
- Heavy deflationary pressure
- Token becomes increasingly scarce

## Circulating Supply Projection

### Launch to Year 5

```
Month 0 (Launch):     200,000,000 (40%)
Month 3:              207,500,000 (41.5%)
Month 6:              215,000,000 (43%)
Month 12 (Year 1):    230,000,000 (46%)
Month 24 (Year 2):    260,000,000 (52%)
Month 36 (Year 3):    290,000,000 (58%)
Month 48 (Year 4):    320,000,000 (64%)
Month 60 (Year 5):    350,000,000 (70%)
```

**Note:** Actual circulating supply will be LOWER due to:
- Buyback and burn (deflationary)
- Locked staking tokens
- Lost/inactive wallets
- Team vesting schedule

## Deflationary Offset

While 2.5M tokens are emitted monthly, the **buyback and burn mechanism** reduces supply:

### Conservative Scenario

- $10,000 monthly tournament volume
- 50% ($5,000) used for buyback
- At $0.003 price = ~1,666,666 tokens burned
- **Net emission:** 2.5M - 1.67M = **833K/month**

### Moderate Scenario

- $50,000 monthly tournament volume
- 50% ($25,000) used for buyback
- At $0.003 price = ~8,333,333 tokens burned
- **Net emission:** 2.5M - 8.33M = **-5.83M/month** (**DEFLATIONARY!**)

### Growth Scenario

- $100,000+ monthly tournament volume
- 50% ($50,000+) used for buyback
- **Heavy net deflation**
- Circulating supply decreases despite emissions

**Implication:** As the platform grows, buybacks can exceed emissions, making the token deflationary even during the 5-year distribution period.

## Comparison to Other Projects

| Project | Distribution Period | Annual Inflation | Model |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| **8-Bit Arcade** | **5 years** | **6-15%** | **Front-loaded** |
| Bitcoin | 100+ years | 1.8% | Halving every 4 years |
| Ethereum | Infinite | 0.5% | Minimal issuance |
| Axie Infinity | 20+ years | 15-30% | Slow distribution |
| DeFi Kingdoms | 30+ years | 20-40% | Very slow |

**8-Bit Arcade Advantage:**
- ✅ Fastest distribution (5 years vs 20-30)
- ✅ Front-loaded (high rewards early)
- ✅ Players benefit NOW, not in 2050
- ✅ Still sustainable with burn mechanics
- ✅ Competitive inflation rate

## Why Front-Loading Works

### Traditional Model (20-30 Years)

**Problems:**
- Most players never see significant rewards
- Project may not survive 20+ years
- Early adopters get minimal rewards
- Requires decades of patience

**Example:**
- Year 1: 500K tokens/month → $150/day for #1
- Year 5: 400K tokens/month → $120/day
- Year 10: 300K tokens/month → $90/day

### 8-Bit Arcade Model (5 Years)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Massive rewards from day one
- ✅ Attracts and retains top players
- ✅ Creates excitement and urgency
- ✅ Rewards early adopters significantly
- ✅ Sustainable through deflationary burns

**Example:**
- Year 1-5: 2.5M tokens/month → $12,187/month for #1 (at $10M mcap)
- Year 6+: Zero emissions → pure deflation

## Impact on Token Price

### Emission Pressure vs. Demand Drivers

**Sell Pressure (Emissions):**
- 2.5M tokens enter circulation monthly
- Some players will sell rewards
- ~$8,000/month sell pressure at $0.003 price

**Buy Pressure (Demand):**
- Tournament entry fees ($10K+ monthly)
- 50% of fees = buyback and burn
- Player demand to enter tournaments
- Investor speculation
- FOMO from earning potential

**Net Effect:** If platform gains traction, buy pressure exceeds sell pressure, resulting in price appreciation despite emissions.

## Staking Pool Emissions

Separate from the main rewards pool:

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pool Size** | 50,000,000 8BIT |
| **Distribution** | 5 years |
| **Monthly Rate** | ~833,333 8BIT (much lower) |
| **Launch** | Phase 3 (Months 7-12) |

Staking emissions are conservative and designed for long-term holders, not immediate payouts.

## What This Means for You

### If You're a Player

- **Years 1-5:** Earn MASSIVE rewards (50K+ daily distributed)
- **Year 6+:** Rewards end, but tokens you earned become scarcer
- **Strategy:** Earn as much as possible during 5-year window

### If You're an Investor

- **Years 1-5:** 15% annual inflation (offset by burns)
- **Year 6+:** Zero inflation = pure deflationary model
- **Long-term:** Token becomes increasingly valuable as supply decreases
