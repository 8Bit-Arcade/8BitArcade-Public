## Key Features

### 🚀 5-Year Accelerated Rewards

Unlike typical projects that distribute rewards over 20-30 years, 8-Bit Arcade uses a **player-first approach**:

- **150M tokens** distributed over **5 years**
- **30M tokens/year** in player rewards
- **Front-loaded distribution** maximizes early earnings
- Players benefit **NOW**, not decades later

### 🔥 Deflationary Model

50% of all tournament entry fees are used to **buyback and burn** 8BIT tokens:

1. Players pay tournament fees in USDC
2. 50% automatically swapped to 8BIT via Uniswap V3
3. Purchased tokens sent to burn address (permanently removed)
4. Remaining 50% funds prize pools

**Effect:** As adoption grows, circulating supply decreases, potentially increasing token value.

### 💎 Deep Liquidity

75M tokens (15% of supply) allocated to DEX liquidity:

- **$75K+ value** at presale price
- Locked on Uniswap V3 for 3-4 years
- Creates deep trading pool
- Minimizes slippage for large trades
- Professional launch vs typical micro-cap projects

### 📊 Ultra-Low Inflation

- **Monthly emissions:** 2.5M tokens (0.50% of supply)
- **Annual inflation:** 6% (Year 1-5 only)
- After Year 5: **Zero new emissions** from rewards pool
- Much lower than typical GameFi projects (15-30% annually)

## Token Utility

### Primary Uses

1. **Tournament Entry Fees** - Pay-to-enter competitive tournaments
2. **Prize Payouts** - Win 8BIT tokens for top rankings
3. **Staking Rewards** (Future) - Stake to earn passive income
4. **Governance** (Future) - Vote on game additions and parameters
5. **NFT Badges** (Future) - Unlock exclusive achievement NFTs

### Value Drivers

- **Player Demand** - Need tokens to enter high-prize tournaments
- **Buyback & Burn** - Constant buy pressure + supply reduction
- **Scarcity** - Fixed max supply, decreasing circulation
- **Utility** - Real use case from day one, not speculation
- **Network Effects** - More players = more tournaments = more burns
