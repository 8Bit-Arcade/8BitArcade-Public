# Staking (Coming Soon)

## Earn Passive Income by Holding 8BIT

Staking allows you to lock your 8BIT tokens and earn passive rewards over time. This feature is planned for Phase 3 (Months 7-12 post-launch).

## Staking Overview

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Launch Timeline** | Phase 3 (Months 7-12) |
| **Staking Pool** | 50,000,000 8BIT (10% of supply) |
| **Distribution Period** | 5 years |
| **Estimated APY** | 15-30% (to be determined) |
| **Lock Periods** | Flexible (likely tiered) |
| **Rewards** | Paid in 8BIT |

## Why Staking?

### For Token Holders

✅ **Passive Income** - Earn rewards without playing games
✅ **Long-term Value** - Incentivizes holding vs selling
✅ **Reduced Volatility** - Locked tokens = less sell pressure
✅ **Additional Utility** - More reasons to hold 8BIT

### For the Ecosystem

✅ **Price Stability** - Reduces circulating supply
✅ **Community Alignment** - Rewards long-term believers
✅ **Sustainable Growth** - 5 year distribution (low inflation)
✅ **Investor Confidence** - Professional tokenomics

## Planned Staking Mechanics

> ⚠️ **Note:** Details below are preliminary and subject to change based on community feedback and market conditions.

### Tiered Lock Periods

Different lock periods offering different rewards:

| Lock Period | Estimated APY | Early Withdrawal Penalty |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| **Flexible** | 15% | None (withdraw anytime) |
| **30 Days** | 20% | 10% penalty |
| **90 Days** | 25% | 15% penalty |
| **180 Days** | 30% | 20% penalty |

**Example:**
- Stake 100,000 8BIT for 180 days at 30% APY
- Earn ~15,000 8BIT in 6 months
- Total after 6 months: 115,000 8BIT

### Reward Distribution

**Monthly Emissions from Staking Pool:**
- ~520,000 8BIT per month (much lower than game rewards)
- Distributed proportionally to all stakers
- Automatically compounded or claimable

**Calculation:**
```
Your Rewards = (Your Staked Amount / Total Staked) × Monthly Pool × APY Multiplier
```

## Additional Staking Benefits (Planned)

Beyond passive rewards, stakers may receive:

### 🎮 Boosted Game Rewards

- **+10% to daily leaderboard rewards** (flexible staking)
- **+25% to daily leaderboard rewards** (90-day lock)
- **+50% to daily leaderboard rewards** (180-day lock)

**Example:**
- Normal #1 reward: 12,500 8BIT/day
- With 180-day staking: 18,750 8BIT/day (+50%)

### 🎟️ Tournament Perks

- **Discounted entry fees** (5-20% off)
- **Exclusive staker-only tournaments**
- **Bonus prize pool allocation**
- **Priority tournament registration**

### 🗳️ Governance Voting

- **Vote on new game additions**
- **Vote on prize pool adjustments**
- **Vote on platform features**
- **Voting power = amount staked**

### 🎨 NFT Badge Access

- **Exclusive NFT badges** for stakers
- **Achievement NFTs** unlocked by staking milestones
- **Special profile customization**

## Staking Pool Sustainability

### 50M Token Pool = 5 Year Distribution

**Monthly Distribution:**
- 833,333 8BIT per month
- 60 months (5 years) to deplete
- Low inflation impact (0.167% monthly)

**Why This Works:**
- Game rewards end after Year 5
- Staking continues as only emission source
- Provides long-term sustainability
- Deflationary burns offset emissions

### APY Adjustments

APY may dynamically adjust based on:
- **Total amount staked** (more staked = lower APY)
- **Market conditions**
- **Platform growth**
- **Community governance votes**

**Example:**
- If 50M 8BIT staked (10% of supply): 30% APY
- If 100M 8BIT staked (20% of supply): 15% APY
- If 200M 8BIT staked (40% of supply): 7.5% APY

## Risks & Considerations

### Smart Contract Risk

- Staking requires trusting the smart contract

### Lock Period Risk

- Tokens locked for chosen period
- Cannot withdraw without penalty
- Price may change during lock

### APY Fluctuation

- APY not guaranteed
- May adjust based on market conditions
- Check current rates before staking

### Opportunity Cost

- Staked tokens can't be sold
- May miss price appreciation opportunities
- Consider market conditions before locking
