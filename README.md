## 💰 Token Economics

**8BIT Token on Arbitrum**

- **Max Supply**: 500,000,000 (500 Million)
- **Initial Price**: $0.0005
- **Market Cap (FDV)**: $250,000
- **Public Sale**: 40% (200M tokens, $100K raise)
- **Future Rewards**: 40% (200M over 5 years)
- **Liquidity**: 12% (60M locked 3+ years)
- **Deflationary**: Tournament fees used to buyback & burn

### Distribution:
| Category | Allocation | Tokens | Unlock |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Public Sale** | 40% | 200M | Immediate |
| **Future Rewards** | 40% | 200M | 5 years (linear) |
| **Liquidity** | 12% | 60M | Immediate (locked 3+ years) |
| **Tournament Prizes** | 4% | 20M | Immediate |
| **Marketing** | 3% | 15M | 6-12 months |

**Deflationary Mechanism:** 50% of tournament fees buyback & burn 8BIT

**See [contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md) for full token distribution details**

### Automated Gas Management

8-Bit Arcade uses an **automated Treasury Gas Manager** to ensure sustainable token distribution:

- **Self-Sustaining** - 1 ETH deposit funds ~2-3 years of automated operations
- **Zero Manual Intervention** - Automatic wallet refills when balance drops below threshold
- **Minimal Cost** - ~$75/year to distribute 30M 8BIT annually on Arbitrum
- **Full Automation** - Makes daily rewards truly automatic and reliable

**Cost Efficiency:** Less than 0.025% of emissions value at $5M market cap

This infrastructure enables the platform to run autonomously without manual gas wallet management.

**Standard Tier** (Accessible)
- Weekly: 2,000 8BIT ($1) entry, 50,000 8BIT ($25) prize
